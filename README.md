### About it

This is an mobile hybrid anime stream application which allows the users watch japanese "animes" 
without ads or bills. The goal of that app is be an example app of my Flutter development short 
course that will be happening on SIMCIT event at UNIFACS University.

All the application data are comming from the brazilian anime stream 
site [Anitube](https://www.anitube.site/). The crawler api used to 
fetch the web site data can be founded [here](https://github.com/sc4v3ng3r/anitube_crawler_api).
